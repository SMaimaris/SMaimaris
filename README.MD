I build cool stuff in C++ and Unreal Engine, from combat systems and AI to in-editor tools that (sometimes) make designers happy.  
Worked across a bunch of prototypes and full projects - multiplayer, PvE, and mobile - using both commercial and custom engines.  

Most of my time is spend on:  
- Gameplay mechanics & systems design  
- Modular ability frameworks  
- Real-time networking & game flow control  
- Tools and UI/UX programming  
- AI behavior trees + ML-assisted agents  

Unreal Engine and C++ is my home base, but I have tinkered with Unity, Godot, Python, the occasional shader language and a tiny bit of Blender.  

Sometimes I even open ASEPRITE for some pixel art fun.
